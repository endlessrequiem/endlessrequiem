# About me
Hi! My name is Austin White, I am an Alumni of CSU Stanislaus (Class of 2020). As a Android Developer, I have 2 years of experience with Java and Kotlin, and I have published 5 apps to the Google Play Store. As CS Club President, I brought the first hackathon to the CSU Stanislaus Campus.
