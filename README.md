# About me
Hi! My name is Austin White, I am an Alumni of CSU Stanislaus (Class of 2020). As a Android Developer, I have 2 years of experience with Java and Kotlin, and I have published 5 apps to the Google Play Store. As CS Club President, I brought the first hackathon to the CSU Stanislaus Campus. Bringing together the first real organized CS community that the campus had ever seen; I also won the award for Most Improved Club From California State University, Stanislaus. Outside of CS, I enjoy writing, I'm currently working on a poetry book that I hope to publish in the future.

I started doing Android Development right after my first programming course. I wanted to see what 
I could build with my new-found Java skills, and Android Development was something that looked interesting. 
The moment I was able to make my first app launch without crashing was the moment I realized that I could be
an Android Developer. Since then, I have published a couple apps in the Google play store and continue to challenge myself with
Android Development. 

As the President of the Computer Science Club, I wanted to push myself to represent my club and my University 
on some of the biggest hackathon stages I could find. Most notably, I've competed at UC Berkeley's CalHacks (October, 2019), University
of Southern California's HackSC (April, 2019), and the TechCruch Disrupt SF Hackathon (October, 2019). Competing at such a 
high level has made me into a better developer by showing me how to develop quality products quickly. To my credit, I do have a 
victory to my name, I won "Best Use of SnapKit" after competing for the first time at HackMerced (March 2019). In April 2020, I moved StanHacks online, since the 
COVID-19 pandemic had forced everything to shut down. The virtual edition of StanHacks saw 230 total participants, which was amassive increase from the 20 we had 
the previous year's in-person event.

As a Google Cloud Developer Group and DSC Lead, I worked with Google to run both a club on campus, and bring 
together the local tech community in Turlock; which is what I did with GDG Cloud Turlock. Through this, I was able to have the resources
to host weekly technical workshops; and in the Fall 2019 semester, I hosted weekly workshops from early September to Early December.
These workshops included topics such as Android, Web Development, Machine Learning, and Git. Not only that, but I got
direct training from Google by attending GDG/DSC events hosted at Google offices in Sunnyvale, CA and San Diego, CA.

Aside from Android Development, I have some experience with Web Development, though not with any specific 
frameworks. My most notable web development project is a Chatbot that I built for a professor as a Research Assistant. The 
goal of this project was to see how much students interact with an always available Chatbot, and the results were very 
positive, about 95% of the students surveyed in the class said that the chatbot helped make their classroom experience 
better. On the technical side, the project was built using AWS Lex with an Ubuntu cloud server with Nginx via AWS Lightsail to 
host the website. The website used the Materialize CSS framework for design. This project is a promising introduction to
chatbots be used widely for both online and in-person classes the CSU Stanislaus campus.
